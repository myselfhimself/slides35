# Slides35

Slides35 is a Python 3 module for generating 35mm slide PNG images from SVG templates.
Such slides can be nice for back-in-time presents or Art exhibitions.

35mm = 1+3⁄8 or 1.375 inches

## TL;DR
To prepare slides for transfer, make or reuse our 24x36mm SVG template and run this script (see **usage** below). This is adapted for 2x2 inches (5x5cm) slide mounts.

## Usage
TODO :)

## About digital picture transfer onto slides
That script helps in the preparatory steps for digital picture transfer onto a transparent surface for 5x5cm slides making (where the picture is 24x36mm).
[That picture to slides transfer technique is explained on the WeAreProjectors website (by Clément Briend).](http://weareprojectors.com/digitalslide/?lang=en#transfertTab) The latter page also lists companies able to transfer pictures onto slides for you, if you preferred not to print them yourself on transparent paper with an inkjet printer.

## The Kodachrome 35mm slide
The standard Kodachrome mount (ie. surrounding frame) size is 2”x2” (inches, or 5.08x5.08cm).
It embeds a 24x36mm image.

## Slides viewers
There are simple slides viewer on the market for less than 60$ or more caroussel-like ones (often second-hand). More advanced devices allow to scan old slides, but this is more and expensive and not what we want here.

One example of such viewers is the [KODAK 35mm Slide and Film Viewer](https://www.kodak.com/en/consumer/product/printing-scanning/film-scanners/kodak-35mm-slide-and-film-viewer).
